## Answer:
```sql
SELECT 
    fm.name AS parent_name,
    COUNT(pcr.child_id) AS total_children,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(pcr.child_id) DESC) AS rank_by_children
FROM parent_child_relationships pcr
JOIN family_members fm ON pcr.parent_id = fm.member_id
GROUP BY fm.name
ORDER BY rank_by_children
LIMIT 3;
