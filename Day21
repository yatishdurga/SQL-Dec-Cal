# Santa's Sleigh Optimization Query

## Question:

Santa needs to optimize his sleigh for Christmas deliveries. Write a query to calculate the total weight of gifts for each recipient type (good or naughty) 
and determine what percentage of the total weight is allocated to each type. Include the `recipient_type`, `total_weight`, and `weight_percentage` in the result.
### Table Name: `gifts`

| gift_id | gift_name      | recipient_type | weight_kg |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1       | Toy Train      | good           | 2.5       |
| 2       | Lumps of Coal  | naughty        | 1.5       |
| 3       | Teddy Bear     | good           | 1.2       |
| 4       | Chocolate Bar  | good           | 0.3       |
| 5       | Board Game     | naughty        | 1.8       |

    FROM gifts
)
SELECT 
    recipient_type,
    SUM(weight_kg) AS total_weight,
    (SUM(weight_kg) / (SELECT total_weight FROM TotalWeight)) * 100 AS weight_percentage
FROM 
    gifts
GROUP BY 
    recipient_type;
