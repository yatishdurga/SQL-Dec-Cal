## Day 4 of SQL Advent Calendar

### Today's Question:
Youâ€™re planning your next ski vacation and want to find the best regions with heavy snowfall. Given the tables `ski_resorts` and `snowfall`, find the average snowfall for each region and sort the regions in descending order of average snowfall. Return the columns `region` and `average_snowfall`.

### Table Name: `ski_resorts`

| resort_id | resort_name       | region           |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1         | Snowy Peaks       | Rocky Mountains  |
| 2         | Winter Wonderland | Wasatch Range    |
| 3         | Frozen Slopes     | Alaska Range     |
| 4         | Powder Paradise   | Rocky Mountains  |

### Table Name: `snowfall`

| resort_id | snowfall_inches |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1         | 60              |
| 2         | 45              |
| 3         | 75              |
| 4         | 55              |

---

### Solution:

```sql
SELECT 
    r.region,
    AVG(s.snowfall_inches) AS average_snowfall
FROM 
    ski_resorts r
JOIN 
    snowfall s ON r.resort_id = s.resort_id
GROUP BY 
    r.region
ORDER BY 
    average_snowfall DESC;
```
