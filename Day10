# Day 10 - SQL Advent Calendar

## Question:

You are tracking your friends' New Yearâ€™s resolution progress. Write a query to calculate the following for each friend:

- **Number of resolutions** they made.
- **Number of resolutions** they completed.
- **Success percentage**: The percentage of resolutions completed out of the total resolutions.
- **Success category** based on the success percentage:
  - **Green**: If success percentage is greater than 75%.
  - **Yellow**: If success percentage is between 50% and 75% (inclusive).
  - **Red**: If success percentage is less than 50%.

### Tables:

**`resolutions`**  
| resolution_id | friend_name | resolution           | is_completed |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| 1             | Alice       | Exercise daily       | 1            |
| 2             | Alice       | Read 20 books        | 0            |
| 3             | Bob         | Save money           | 0            |
| 4             | Bob         | Eat healthier        | 1            |
| 5             | Charlie     | Travel more          | 1            |
| 6             | Charlie     | Learn a new skill    | 1            |
| 7             | Diana       | Volunteer monthly    | 1            |
| 8             | Diana       | Drink more water     | 0            |
| 9             | Diana       | Sleep 8 hours        | 1            |

## Answer:

To calculate the required statistics, we will:
1. Count the total number of resolutions (`num_resolutions`).
2. Count the completed resolutions (`num_completed`).
3. Calculate the success percentage.
4. Classify each friend's success based on the percentage.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
-- Day 10 - SQL Advent Calendar

-- Track New Year's resolution progress for friends

SELECT
    friend_name,
    COUNT(resolution_id) AS num_resolutions,                 
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_completed = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS num_completed, 
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN is_completed = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(resolution_id), 2) AS success_percentage, 
    CASE 
        WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN is_completed = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(resolution_id) > 75 THEN 'Green'
        WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN is_completed = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(resolution_id) BETWEEN 50 AND 75 THEN 'Yellow'
        ELSE 'Red'
    END AS success_category 
FROM resolutions
GROUP BY friend_name
ORDER BY friend_name;
``
